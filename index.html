    <h1>WELCOME TO CHRIS AND TIFF'S WEDDING WEBSITE  </h1>
    <div class="wordstuffs">
      <h2> When is it? </h2>
      <p> November 9th, 2019 at 3PM EST</p>
      <h2> Where is it? </h2>
      <p> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bU5HkSTqAEZutLNv9"> 26 Bridge</a> in Brooklyn, New York</p>
      <h2> Where should I stay? </h2>
      <p> In general, we'd recommend anything that looks good (and has decent reviews) to you on Priceline, Expedia, etc. Here are our recommendations, but if you want to broaden your search to AirBNBs or the like, we also have recommend neighborhoods below.<p>
      <p> Recommended Hotels: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.ihg.com/hotelindigo/hotels/us/en/new-york/nycos/hoteldetail">Indigo LES</a></li>

        <li><a href="http://www.wyndhamgardenchinatownnyc.com/"> Wyndham Chinatown</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p> Recommended Neighborhoods: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/f82uV4YDbAmXFcFL6">East Village</a>/<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SXvdekpzdCRijrbs5">Union Square</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HS4SYx99mNw2YRDt5">Lower East Side, Manhattan</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kAXvbx4sBxjDAjNTA"> DUMBO, Brooklyn </a>(nearest to the venue, not as convenient to everything else)</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.wyndhamgardenchinatownnyc.com/">Chinatown</a></li>
        <li>If you want to stay somewhere else - that's probably fine, too! New York is pretty small, so feel free to check in with us and we'll help you out</li>
      </ul>
      <h2> What should I wear? </h2>
      <p> We want you to be comfortable and have a good time, so there is no dress code. The wedding is indoors, so anything from business casual to formal should work (athleisure, too), but if you're planning on taking a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge on your way (not recommended in heels, probably great in athleisure), you're going to want to check the weather -- November in New York is a crapshoot. </p>
      <h2> Is there anything else I should know? </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="www.zola.com/registry/tiffanyandchrisnovember9">Our Registry</a></li>
        <li> We will have someone to help with childcare so you can grab a plate of food, have a conversation, or dance when <b class="ityours"> YOUR</b> <b class="jam">JAM</b> comes on, but the venue is not child-proofed as we know very little about child-rearing. </li>
        <li> Dietary restrictions and dinner: There will be vegetarian and gluten free options available. If you're a vegan or have any other dietary restrictions/concerns, let us know ASAP so we can make sure you're taken care of.</li>
        <li> If you're not a New Yorker and you'd like some specific recommendations for what to do in your downtime - let us know! We love giving New York-specific advice!</li>
      </ul>
